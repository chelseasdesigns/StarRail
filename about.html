            <p>The game is set in a science fantasy universe in which humanity follows certain paths of beings called Aeons. The player character, 
                the Trailblazer, awakens without their memory aboard a space station and discovers that they are imbued with a Stellaron, a disruptive cosmic entity. They join a band of adventurers, the Trailblazers, traveling from world to 
                world aboard the Astral Express, their space train. In an attempt to discover their origins and eliminate the threats of the remaining Stellarons, the
                Trailblazer departs with the Astral Express crew. Their first destination is Jarilo VI, a planet that has been mostly ravaged by an
                uninhabitable winter due to the power of a Stellaron. As the crew nears, the Astral Express is revealed to be unable to leave until the
                Stellaron is handled.</p>

            <p>Honkai: Star Rail follows the gameplay style of classic Japanese role-playing games: players build up a lineup of characters, and control
                a team of four in turn-based combat. Elements of open-world and dungeon exploration are present, with multiple mechanics, including
                the gacha system, carried over from HoYoverse's action RPG Genshin Impact.

            <p>Simulated Universe is a rogue-like game mode unlocked after completing Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta. The gameplay revolves
                around collecting upgrades, known as Blessings, that have good synergy with each other and the team. These Blessings are categorized
                by Paths, the powers of the Aeons (celestial gods), which grants players an advantage during the 13 levels of this game mode.
